Greenville is known as the cultural, economical, and educational hub of North Carolina's Inner Banks, the geographical area east of Raleigh and west of the North Carolina coast. The city boasts a vibrant business community and is ranked among the top places nationally to play, bike, and study. In 2004, Greenville was named Sportstown USA for the state of North Carolina by Sports Illustrated and the National Parks & Recreation Association.  The city is also known as \"BMX Pro Town USA\", as it is home for many top professional BMX riders, such as Dave Mirra, Ryan Nyquist, Ryan Guettler, Mike Laird, and Josh Harrington.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nGreenville is in a central relative location, being equidistant from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Raleigh"]]}," (to the west) and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Outer Banks"]]}," (to the east).
