Kumasi is widely regarded as the cultural cradle of Ghana as the vibrancy of Ghana's culture is more evident here than any part of the country.  The Asantehene still sits in state as Ashantis from all walks of life pay homage.  He even presides over traditional courts and some residents use this instead of the judicial system.\n\nKumasi was established by the King Osei Tutu I with guidance from the priest Okomfo Anokye.  It is said he planted two Kuma trees at two locations.  One died and that place was called Kumawu (thus the Kuma tree died) and the one at Kumasi flourised and was named Kumasi (Kuma tree has flourished).\n\nPopulation of about 2 million, the language is predominantly Akan Twi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nKumasi is a cosmopolitan city with a good road network and one can travel on local buses which ply predetermined routes or charter\/hire taxis to take one to his preferred destination.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nFlights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Accra"]]}," to Kumasi are in the morning and afternoon on the three carriers: Fly540Africa, CitiLink and Antrak.  The flight is about 45 minutes long, limited on luggage allowance.  Excellent way to get to Kumasi, preferred by most.  Small planes, yet short trip. The cost on CitiLink is +-$90 USD one way, and $95 on Antrak as of June 2011 and $86 with Fly540Africa as of March 2012.\n\nFrom May 2012 star bow airlines are flying this and other routes from Accra.

The STC bus service does not seem to be running anymore, or very sporadically; however private bus companies like VIP Jeoun (a Korean company) have taken over this route. Price is 25 cedis for a very comfortable and luxury bus (every row contains three seats; two on one side and one on the other), or 16 cedis for regular touring bus (4 seats in each row).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe tro-tro station in the city centre offers the widest range of destinations.
