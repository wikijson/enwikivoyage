European presence started with the Fraser Gold Rush in the 1858 with permanent non-native settlement beginning in the 1870s, but settlement was slow until the valley was connected to Vancouver by rail in 1915.  In the days of the Fraser Gold Rush Trail, steamboat and other water traffic voyaged from New Westminster via Harrison Lake  near the east end of the Fraser Valley to Port Douglas at the north end of Harrison Lake, then up a rough wagon road along the Lillooet River to the south end of Lillooet Lake, then by boat again to Port Pemberton at the Head of Lillooet Lake (near today's Mount Currie), then overland along the Birkenhead and Gates Rivers to Anderson Lake, where more boats to Seton Portage and Seton Lake landed at the head of another wagon road near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lillooet"]]},". One of the early attractions of the valley was the richness of the soil and farming continues to be important to the area. The Pemberton Valley is an important center for seed potatoes and, more recently, organic farming, with a big Slow Food \/ Tere Madre movement. Pemberton is a bedroom community of  Whistler.\n\nRecent decades have seen a rise in the importance of tourism: including outdoor recreation,  eco & agro-tourism. The nearby mountains and lakes provide a wealth of opportunities activities at all levels, for the most intrepid to just generally being outdoors and taking in the scenery. For the outdoor enthusiast there is in the Summer: biking, backpacking, boating, hiking, horse riding, golfing, & mountaineering. In the winter, skiing, sledding \/ snowmobiling, snowshoeing, snowboarding, ice climbing, to hockey, skating & curling on the smaller Lakes. For flight enthusiasts Pemberton is a centre of hang gliding, paragliding, gliding, skydiving, and heli-tours with the town's own airport for private planes, small jets & helicopters. The Valley just finished hosting the Canadian Paragliding Nationals in 2012.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Pemberton & District Visitor Information Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.tourismpembertonbc.com\/"],["email="],["address=Hwy 99 & Portage Rd"],["lat=50.31691"],["long=-122.79880"],["directions=across from the PetroCan gas station"],["phone=+1 604 894-6175"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=9AM-5PM early May to late Sept"],["price= Free"],["content= Visitor information center with information on local businesses, events and activities."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe main way in and out of the Pemberton area is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Highway 99"]},".
