It is located approximately 190 miles (310 km) south-west of London, where the River Plym and the River Tamar (pronounced \"TAY-mar\") flow into the large bay of Plymouth Sound, creating a perfect natural harbour. The sea has been at the heart of Plymouth since it was founded in the middle-ages as a trading post and the source of its prosperity. Indeed, Plymouth was the point from which the Pilgrim Fathers left England in 1620 for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Massachusetts"]]}," - commemorated today in the Mayflower Steps (see below).\n\nPlymouth is one of England's classic ocean cities, and for centuries has been a centre for shipping; first for trade and commercial shipping, and today as a base for the Royal Navy.

After the war, a comprehensive reconstruction plan at first produced the carefully-planned urban spaces and elegant buildings of the shopping streets in the city centre, constructed in the 1950s. However, due to budget restrictions many of the buildings erected in the 1960s and 70s were of poor architectural quality, and these are now being torn down and replaced across the city by modern ones (with exceptions of some quality, such as the listed tower of the Civic Centre on the Royal Parade). As a result, there are many modern buildings with others under construction.\n\nPlymouth is a friendly city with an egalitarian feel and a sense of openness among its people, and there is less evidence of a sharp divide between rich and poor that is found in much of the southern half of England.

There is a large military presence in the city, with the Royal Navy's main base at Devonport, a commando regiment of the British Army at the Royal Citadel, and a Royal Marines base at Stonehouse. In addition, you'll likely find a lot of tourists (especially in the summer), students (the University of Plymouth has 30,000) and locals working in all sorts of occupations, in sectors from the NHS to retail.\n\nFamous Plymothians (native or adopted) include Elizabethan explorer and adventurer ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sir Francis Drake"]},", diver and Olympic medal-winner ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tom Daley"]},", artist ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beryl Cook"]}," (whose paintings often depicted life in Plymouth), and musician ",{"type":"'''","value":["Seth Lakeman"]}," (some of whose songs reference past events or places in the city).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Plymouth shown within Devon and UK.png"],["thumb"],["Location of Plymouth, shown within Devon and UK"]]},"The city is located at the south-west corner of Devon, with Cornwall beginning immediately to the west of the city.

This produces one of the world's most impressive natural harbours, in which you'll see innumerable yachts, sailing ships, kayaks, other pleasure craft, and even small fishing vessels (of which there are a reasonable number in Plymouth). The Sound is protected from the sea by a huge breakwater at its southern end, easily seen from the shore. You'll often see naval vessels around it.\n\nImmediately above the water is a grassy area called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Plymouth Hoe"]}," (always just called \"the Hoe\"), whose names comes from a Saxon word for \"grassy slope\".

The area was first recorded in the Domesday book as \"Sudtone\" (1086; later Sutton), which was located where the Barbican area of the city is today. Around this time also existed the trading port of Plymstock, further up the river (it still exists today as a suburb). However, the River Plym at Plymstock silted up in the 11th century and the area gradually came to be known as \"Plymouth\". ",{"type":"'''","value":["The sea"]}," has always been at the heart of Plymouth's story and it has a long and historic seafaring tradition. Its growth from a small fishing village and then trading port has been based on its position on one of the world's largest natural harbours and the enterprise of its seafarers - fishermen, merchants, privateers and later the Royal Navy.\n\nPlymouth was the home of Elizabethan privateer and hero\/villain ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sir Francis Drake"]}," (though he was born at Tavistock a few miles north), and from here he planned his raids and other maritime adventures. In 1588, the English Navy, which was led in part by Drake, set sail from Plymouth to defeat the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Spanish Armada"]},". It is said that Drake refused to leave port until he had finished his game of bowls on the Hoe. While this is probably more legend than history, there is still a bowls club on the Hoe today. In 1620 the Pilgrim Fathers sailed to the New World after setting into Plymouth for repairs, escaping from religious persecution to eventually set up Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts. Plymouth was a stronghold of Parliamentarian forces in the English Civil War, written across its history in areas such as Freedom Fields park. After the restoration, the new King, Charles II, ordered the construction of a massive fort (the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Royal Citadel"]},") to protect the town from invaders - such was its strategic importance. But the fort's guns also faced inland, it is said as a signal to the people of the city about where their loyalties should lie! The Royal Citadel is still home to a unit of the Army today. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Royal Dockyard"]}," was built in the area, on the banks of the River Tamar, in 1690. Together with the towns of Devonport and Stonehouse, Plymouth was amalgamated in 1914 to form the modern city which was granted city status in 1928. It also includes the historic areas of Plymstock and Plympton.\n\nThe city was seriously damaged by bombing during the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Second World War"]}," (1939–45) and the city-centre was extensively redeveloped afterwards. At Charles Cross, the ruined Charles Church was left as a memorial to the many dead. Behind it, the Drake Circus shopping centre was constructed to frame it in dramatic fashion, as an impressive entrance to the city from the south-east. The shopping streets of the city-centre were first to be ",{"type":"'''","value":["reconstructed"]},", according to the grand plan of Sir Patrick Abercrombie. This resulted in the elegant large buildings from the 1950s that can be seen on streets such as Armada Way, New George Street, and Cornwall Street. However, these are now in need of restoration. Much of the rest of the reconstruction involved cheap buildings in the Brutalist style fashionable in the 1960s and 1970s, most of which had no architectural merit. However, exceptions included the Civic Centre which is Grade II listed (the City Council moved out in 2010 to save money). Many of the worst of these buildings have been demolished and replaced with much better, modern buildings of generally good quality. However, many historic buildings remain, particularly in the Barbican area, isolated city-centre examples such as the City Museum, and also outside the city-centre which escaped the worst of the bombing (e.g. the Royal William Yard).\n\nWith its dramatic coastal setting, the surrounding landscape is quite striking. Plymouth is by turns rugged and hilly, or green and rolling. Famous Dartmoor was designated a National Park in 1951. Popular sites include Smeaton's Tower (a lighthouse rebuilt on the Hoe from its original location at Eddystone Rock when it was replaced with a new one), the Mount Batten Peninsula, the National Marine Aquarium, and Buckland Abbey, which was Drake's former home. Tourism is an important aspect of Plymouth's economy. Nearly 12 million people visit Plymouth every year. As well as all the attractions of a modern city, Plymouth is a popular launch pad to other notable areas including the beaches and footpaths of the Devon and Cornwall coastline and the brooding landscape of nearby Dartmoor.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geology"]},"\nThe city of Plymouth covers multiple rock types, the Hoe, in the south of the city is composed of Devonian Limestone, which was also used for building a fairly high proportion of the city (most of the older houses and buildings are at least fronted with the stone). the area around the Station is formed of mudstone, which too is Devonian.
