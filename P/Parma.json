Sites across the river require a little more walking but still not too much. The terrain is flat and biking is very popular among the locals. Taxis are easily available at the train station and across the street from the Governor's Palace (Palazzo del Governatore) in the center of town. There are rental cars at the small airport just outside town. Parking can be a challenge downtown. However there are several parking garages outside the city center, the largest of which is behind Teatro Due. The city has an access control system which limits entrance to the city center to local tagged vehicles only. This system is generally switched off after midnight. There is an extensive local bus line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lungoparma.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The Lungoparma.

The baptistry was designed by Benedetto Antelami and is constructed from a pink marble called rosso di Verona. The marble appears to change color depending on how the sun hits it. It is one of the most recognized medieval structures in the country. The frescoes inside the building are very moving, as well as the relief sculptures on the interior stone. The painting inside the dome of the cathedral is one of the most remarkable paintings of the Renaissance. Entitled \"Assumption of the Virgin\" by Correggio, it shows the Virgin Mary being taken up to Heaven. For dramatic effect it is superior to the Sistine Chapel and Titian himself is reputed to have acknowledged that he could not have achieved this effect. Unfortunately the prior who commissioned the work was rather conservative and Correggio never worked in Parma again. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi (Garibaldi Square)"]}," is where the original Roman Colony, founded in 183 BC, had a forum.

If you can get your hands on some genuine Culatello, do it, because it is next to impossible to find in the U.S. and can go for around $60.00 a pound.\n\nParma is also known for its delicate stuffed pastas and outdoor markets.
