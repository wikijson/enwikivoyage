Cairns is also supported by agricultural businesses which include sugar cane, bananas, coffee, tea and the world's first tropical fruit wine region.\n\nPeak season in Cairns is during the more comfortable winter months of June–August, especially compared to the hotter and stickier summer months. A particularly busy time occurs in the first two weeks of July, when Australian school kids get their winter break.\n\nThere is no swimming beach to speak of in central Cairns, although there are many choices just north and south of the city.

Kuranda (elevation 330 m) is 25 km from Cairns via the Kennedy Highway, which snakes its way over the Macalister Range. However, most visitors reach the town by taking the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway or Kuranda Railroad, both of which offer transfers to Cairns and package deals with Kuranda attractions. Skyrail travels above the rainforest with stations along the route to explore the rainforest environment and view the Barron River Falls. The Kuranda Railway makes a scenic trip through Barron Gorge National Park. The town itself offers plenty of shopping and is home to several wildlife parks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Further out"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Mareeba, the edge of the outback, where the sun shines 300 days a year, and they produce 80% of Australia's coffee crop.
