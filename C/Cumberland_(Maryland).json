Main thoroughfares coming into Cumberland are US 220, US 40, Interstate 68, MD 36, and WV 28. Amtrak's Capitol Limited line also arrives at the station in downtown Cumberland twice daily: eastbound towards Washington, DC in the morning; and westbound, towards Chicago in the evening.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nWalking is not only the best method, but also the only method for exploring the downtown area. The Baltimore Street commercial district is closed to traffic and is a pedestrian-only mall. Within a few blocks of this area, one can easily walk to the Canal Place Heritage Area, the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, the Washington Street Historic District, as well as a variety of other shops and restaurants. It is important to note that while it is possible to walk from the train station to the only downtown hotel, the Holiday Inn, one has to cross a high-traffic section of railroad tracks to access the hotel as well as the rest of the downtown area.\n\nIn order to explore the rest of the city and region, however, having a car is advised. Be aware that in the downtown area, parking can sometimes be difficult to find. One public parking garage is available: the Center City Garage on the corner of Pershing and George Streets.  There is also a small parking lot accessible from Liberty Street, but the parking garage at this location is now by permit only. There is visitor parking at the Western Maryland Station on Mechanic street, and metered parking under the Crosstown Bridge (I-68), and along many side streets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Allegany County Courthouse"],["url=http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/history\/nr\/travel\/Cumberland\/crt.htm"],["email="],["address=30 Washington St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The city's most prominent building, which looms over the Cumberland skyline, is fortunately very pretty."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Brooke Whiting House of Art"],["url=http:\/\/www.whitinghouse.org"],["email="],["address=632 Washington St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 301 777-7782"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Th-Sa 10AM-4PM, tours every hour on the hour"],["price="],["content=Brooke Whiting, a wealthy world traveler from Cumberland, bequeathed his house and large art collection to the city as a museum.
