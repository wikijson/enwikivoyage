These Sahelian kingdoms had neither rigid geopolitical boundaries nor rigid ethnic identities.

Mansa Musa, who ruled in the early 14th century, is regarded as the wealthiest person in history (est.$400 billion adjusted for inflation!) owing to the Malian Empire's production of gold & salt. He used this wealth to build some of the impressive mosques still to be found around the country. The empire later declined, ultimately being supplanted by the Songhai Empire. The Songhai people originated in current northwestern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nigeria"]]},". In the late 14th century, the Songhai gradually gained independence from the Mali Empire and expanded until eventual collapse largely due to a Moroccan invasion in 1591. The fall of the Songhai Empire marked the end of the region's role as a trading crossroads. Following the establishment of sea routes by European powers, the trans-Saharan trade routes lost significance. \n\nIn the colonial era, Mali fell under the control of the French beginning in the late 19th century.

One of the best options is to rent a car with a chauffeur. This can be done on a by-day basis and is an enormous help for someone that is new to the city. When trying to visit numerous places in one day, it becomes difficult to rely on the local taxi system. The chauffeur is a local resident and will know most of the names of the places that you need to go. There is no hassle in finding a parking spot as the chauffeur can wait for you while you attend to the business at hand.  \n\nFor the tourist, this option can be your solution to seeing the city of Bamako in a care-free manner. Trips out of the city are available as well, although the fare can be somewhat higher than intra-city rates. Gas is an additional cost to the renter. A distinguished man by the name of Aldiouma (pronounced al-Jew-ma) Togo runs a classy operation is open to negotiation for rates. Usually around XOF25,000-30,000 per day for intra-city use.

You can find little tables along the roadsides and near transport centers.\n\nSnacks you may find for sale include little cakes (especially in bus stations), various fried doughs (either sweet or with hot sauce), peanuts, roasted corn if in season, sesame sticks, and frozen juices in little plastic sacks. Fresh fruit is widely available and always delicious. Some of the best are mangoes, papaya, watermelon, guavas, bananas and oranges - the particular selection depends on the season.\n\nOf course, as in any tropical, underdeveloped country, food borne disease is a major concern for the traveller. The main culprits for diarrhoea are untreated water (especially in rural areas) and fruits and vegetables which have not been peeled or soaked in bleach water - salads (even in fancy restaurants!) are likely to cause problems. You should also be sure any food (especially meat) is thoroughly cooked - generally more of a problem with Western food in restaurants than with Malian foods (which are usually cooked for hours). Drink bottled water, and talk to your doctor about bringing an antibiotic like ",{"type":"''","value":["cipro"]}," to treat diarrhoea that is severe or does not improve over a couple days.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nTreat tap water with suspicion. It is often so heavily chlorinated that one suspects few bugs could possibly survive in it. But short-term visitors will be safer with bottled water. There are several cheap local brands, but be warned that they are only drunk by foreigners and wealthy Malians: don't rely on finding bottled water in shops patronised by \"ordinary\" Malians. Soft drinks such as Coca-Cola or Fanta are more widely available and safe. But remember that Coke will make you want to go to the toilet, and so may leave you more dehydrated than before you drank it - a serious problem in this stunningly hot country.  \nStreet vendors sell water and home-made ginger and berry drinks in little plastic bags.  They are often iced which makes them very refreshing in the heat.  Generally, you shouldn't drink these without treating them first.  \n\nHowever, one which is called \"bissap\" in French and \"dabileni\" (\"red hybiscus\") in Bambara, is made from hibiscus flowers that are boiled during preparation, and so generally is safe to drink.  It is a particularly delicious non-alcoholic drink you shouldn't miss.  In Bamako, it is possible to purchase at most corner stores treated water in small plastic bags for XOF50; these are much cheaper, and of course more environmentally friendly, than bottles.  The bags are marked with a brand name;  be careful not to mistake them for the tap water that is sold in unmarked plastic bags by street vendors.  Also widely sold in this way is sweet milk and yoghurt, which are normally clean because the bags are industrially filled. Fresh milk can also be bought from buckets at the roadside in some villages, although it should always be thoroughly boiled before drinking as it can carry tuberculosis bacteria (often Malians do this before selling, but it is safer to do it yourself or at least ask).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["disclaimerbox"],["Because of the dramatic decline in the number of tourists\/visitors due to the conflict in the north, many hotels have closed across the country...even high-end ones.

You will pay USD60-100 per night (and up) for a what would be a decent to nice hotel by western standards. At the other end of the spectrum you can pay about USD5-10 per night for a bed or mattress (usually with mosquito net and sheets) in a room or on the roof. Such places will usually have toilets and showers in a shared facility (think camp site camping with less gear). All tourist areas have hotels or auberges and many places will also have homestays. Sleeping on the roof terrace, if available, is not only the cheapest option but also usually the coolest and gives you the pleasure of sleeping under the stars (which are incredibly bright outside of Bamako because there is so little light pollution) - just use your mosquito net and be prepared to wake to prayer call at 05:00.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\nMali has numerous musical instruments you can learn.

In June 2012, Mali was hit by a political crisis and a civil war, which temporarily split the country into two parts: the north being named as \"Azawad\" and being controlled by a group of Islamist rebels, whilst the south experienced a military junta. Travelling in Timbuktu and Gao provinces is particularly extremely dangerous, and as of July 2012, the Islamist rebel groups have ordered all shrines which are considered to involve idolatry to be destroyed. The U.S., Canada and UK travel advisories have since continued to advise against ",{"type":"'''","value":["all travel to Mali at this time"]},".\n\nThe train between Bamako and Kayes is notorious for theft: if taking the train, you should exercise extreme caution, carry a pocket flashlight, and keep your belongings with you and valuables directly on your person at all times.\n\nYou also have a good chance of encountering the police. They are generally mostly concerned with directing traffic and fining people for improper papers, so you have little to fear from them, but always at least carry a copy of your passport and visa (and preferably the original if keep it secure).\n\nCarrying only a driving license is not sufficient and might lead to a ride to the police office unless you bribe your way out. Notice that the police in Bamako often stop taxis, although this can be somewhat avoided by never putting more than four passengers in the car and by taking only \"official\" cabs (the ones with the red plates ",{"type":"''","value":["only"]},": in Bamako, a car with white plates is not an official taxi even if it has a taxi sign on top, regardless of what the driver may tell you).\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["northeast"]}," half of Mali (everything north and east of Mopti Province) is simply not safe for travel, as the murky alliance of Al Qaeda and Tuareg rebel groups have been targeting foreigners for ",{"type":"'''","value":["kidnappings"]},".

All travellers should plan to take a malaria prophylaxis throughout their time in Mali (mephloquine and Malarone are the most common). The other main precautions are to use insect repellent in the evenings and to sleep under a mosquito net in all but the fancy, sealed, air-conditioned hotels. This will significantly lower your exposure to malaria as the mosquitoes that carry the parasite are only active at night, but you would want to take these precautions even without the risk of malaria simply to avoid being covered in itchy mosquito bites! You will almost never see or be bothered by mosquitoes during the day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Food and water"]},"\nStay away from dirty food and water. The rule \"cook it peel it or forget it\" should be followed. Also water should only be drunk out of sealed bottles or after it is sterilized through boiling or chemical utensils. The food is another issue. It's sometimes difficult to know if it's cooked long enough. Also the, to Westerners, unusual spices are sometimes the cause for sickness, especially diarrhoea. Also expect little stones or bits of grit in the meal, especially the local couscous (this doesn't mean it's unsafe though, as it has been cooked long and thoroughly). For the traveller the main danger is diarrhoea. For mild diarrhoea you should be sure to get lots of rest, drink lots of clean water and eat soft plain foods. If the diarrhoea is severe or lasts several days, be prepared to take antibiotics. During the illness the body will lose a lot of water and salt.
