The charge is OMR0.100 (100 Bzs) from the Corniche area to the church roundabout and another 100 Bzs from the church round about to Wadi Adai.\n\nOn arrival at the airport, situated approximately 40km from the main Muscat CBD, you can get a baisa bus down the main highway in either direction.\n\nThe (mostly orange and white) taxis are a bit pricier, and they hang around the hotels where they get juicy fares from unwary travellers.

They always say they will give you \"good price\", but it's best to figure out what you want to spend then agree before you get in.\n\nThe Maxi Taxis ply the main routes through town, and they go where they want so you might have to find one going your direction. Once you are on one, they will make sure you get there. The place to wait for them is on the on-ramps of most of the main highway junctions, when you'll usually see a few people waiting around for one.

A 2WD is fine to see the sights within and around Muscat, but if you're planning to explore wadis and mountains you'll need a 4WD.\n\nRoad signs in Muscat can be confusing, and motorway exits are not always clearly marked. Compared with elsewhere in the Gulf (e.g. Dubai and Doha) Muscat drivers are reasonably disciplined, but visitors from outside the region may find the local driving style erratic. For a gentler introduction into Muscat traffic it may be easier to take a taxi (or hotel-provided shuttle) from the airport, and arrange for a rental car through your accommodation – rates are usually the same as if not better than at the airport.\n\nMost local and international rental agencies have offices at the airport. An international driver's permit is theoretically required to rent a car, but usually agents will request only your national licence. All car hires include mandatory insurance. The cheapest car hire is about OMR15 per day for a 2WD economy car with manual transmission and sometimes no air-conditioning; for a 4WD, expect to pay double that amount.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=ABC"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 582663"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A local agency."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Al Maskry Rent-a-Car"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.almaskry.com\/"],["email=info@almaskry.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 99438661, +968 99381524"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A well-established local agency."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Avis Oman"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.avisoman.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 510342 (airport), +968 24 400888 (city)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Budget Oman"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.budgetoman.com\/"],["email=budgetom@omantel.net.om"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 683999"],["tollfree="],["fax=+968 24 683966"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Europcar"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.europcar.com\/car-rental-OMAN-MUSCAT.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 521369 (airport), +968 24 521369 (city)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Hertz"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hertz.com\/rentacar\/reservation\/home"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 521187 (airport), +968 24 625200 (city)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=National"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.nationalcar.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 521369 (airport), +968 24 601081 (city)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Sixt"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.sixt.com\/car-rental\/oman\/muscat"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 510224 (airport), +968 24 482793 (city)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Thrifty"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.thrifty.com\/local\/index.aspx?LocationCode=MCT"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+968 24 521189 (airport), +968 23 211493 (city)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Old Muscat (2).jpg"],["thumb"],["Al Jalali Fort"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Qasr Al Alam Royal Palace (7).jpg"],["thumb"],["Qasr Al Alam Royal Palace"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Muscat Gate Museum.jpg"],["thumb"],["Muscat Gate Museum"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Muscat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Al Jalali Fort"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Qasr Al Alam St"],["lat=23.616531"],["long=58.597961"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["image=Old Muscat (2).jpg"],["hours="],["price="],["content=Built as a prison in the rocky mountains in the 1580s during the Portuguese occupation, now converted into a museum devoted to Omani heritage.
