Set in beautiful cloud-forest, it attracts birdwatchers first and foremost, but also has attractions for other tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nMindo is located to the north west of Quito. This town was founded in 1861 and the current population is around 3000 inhabitants. Mindo is surrounded by the Mindo-Nambillo Cloud Forest; the forest is home to hundreds of species of birds many of them are in danger of extinction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are bus services from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santo Domingo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quito"]]},". The bus is $2.50 each way from Quito and it is not possible to buy a round trip ticket in Quito, just a one-way.\n\nThe bus company is called Flor de Valle \/ Cayambe and departs from Terminal Terrestre Norte, La Ofelia (look for the Terminal Microregional sign).  It moved a few years ago so ignore any references elsewhere on outdated websites and postings to it departing from Mariscal, since this is no longer the case.  It is about a 30 to 40 minute taxi ride from the tourist area (Mariscal) to the bus station which is in the north of Quito at La Ofelia, or you can take the \"Metrobus\" bus rapid transit.\n\nYou can purchase tickets from Quito to Mindo in advance through a local travel agency such as Andesconexion for a $10 fee and pay by credit card for about the cost of a $10 round-trip taxi ride from the Mariscal\/new town in Quito to Ofelia. Seats on the right hand side of the bus to Mindo are more scenic.  If you are going for a day trip, you should buy your return bus ticket immediately upon arrival in Mindo or you are at risk of not being able to return that day. If you are staying more than a day, buy your return trip at least one day in advance or first thing in the morning.\n\nThere are many more direct buses to and from Quito at weekends than during the week. As well as direct services, buses go fairly regularly from the Flor del Valle station to Los Bancos. Other bus lines are Kennedy, Aloag, San Pedrito These do not go into Mindo itself, but they pull over at the edge of the main road running along the top of the valley. From here it is usually easy to hop in a truck for $0.50-$3.00 depending on the number of passengers and go downhill into town. Similarly, you can return to Quito by getting a truck to take you up to the main road and catching a bus back. Just ask around in town.\n\nIf there are no seats left on the returning buses, it is possible to rent a car and a driver from the transportation company across the street and up the block for $40-50.\n\nAnother way for those travellers is to hire a private professional Tour Guide on a 4WD to and from Quito $100-120, 9 hours service. The tour has different stops on the way from Quito to Mindo: the first stop in Pululahua crater view, Pahuma orchid Reserve, hummingbirds balcony (chance for photos), butterfly farm in Mindo, tarabita (cable car) and optional zip line in Mindo, lunch and possible short stop at the Equator Line on the way back to Quito.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nSee the birds of Mindo.\nMindo is home to over 450 species of birds, a great variety of butterflies, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, making Mindo a paradise for eco-tourism.
