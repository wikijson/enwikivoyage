Many, however, have heard of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Manipal"]},", a major educational centre, and a suburb of Udupi, that attracts students from all over India and internationally.\n\nRather confusingly, the town of Udupi lies in Udupi ",{"type":"''","value":["taluka"]}," which in turn is in Udupi district. This article covers   not only the town, but also its surrounding areas, the region roughly corresponding to Udupi taluka. The taluka is one of the three divisions of Udupi district.

The other two talukas are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kundapura"]]}," on  its north and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karkala"]]},", which on the west, at the foothills of the Western Ghats.

He is the founder of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dvaita"]}," philosophy, which is commonly translated as ",{"type":"'''","value":["dualism"]},". In contrast to the older ",{"type":"'''","value":["Advaita"]}," (non-dualism) propounded by Sankaracharya, Dvaita philosophy holds that the human and animate souls have an independent existence from the divine Universal Soul, of the Paramatma. The adherents of the Dvaita philosophy are generally Vaishnavites, who worship Vishnu in his various incarnations, among whom Krishna is one.\n\nLegend has it that Madhvacharya used his divine powers to miraculously save a ship that was in the thick of a storm. The ship happened to have set sail from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dwaraka"]]},", the city that used to be Krishna's home, and was carrying an idol of him. The captain of the ship, in gratitude, gifted the idol to his saviour, who then went on to install it in the Krishna temple where he worshiped.\n\nIn the midst of propounding his philosophy and performing miracles, Madhvacharya also found time to establish a monastic order consisting of eight mathas (",{"type":"''","value":["Ashtamathas"]},") located in various places around Udupi. Each of these mathas were headed by one of his main disciples, and he decreed that after he passed on, they and their successors would head the main Udupi matha in rotation for two months each. One of his notable later day successors, Vadiraja of Sode Matha, who lived during the 16th century, changed the tenure from two months to two years.  This practice, called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Paryaya"]}," continues to this day. The handover to the new head of Udupi matha happens on 18 January on even numbered years, and is an occasion for much celebration and many religious ceremonies.\n\nPolitically, the city had an uneventful history. It was ruled by various feudatories of the Mysore kings till it was taken over by the British, who then made it part of the administrative district of Kanara, which was then divided into South and North Kanara.  Udupi was part of the former. After independence, South Kanara became Dakshina Kannada, and in 1998, Udupi district was hived off from Dakshina Kannada, with the city as the headquarters of the district.\n\nIt had a nascent career as a financial hub till the 60s, with many banks being established here, but most of them got nationalized. Manipal, a suburb of Udupi city is an important educational and medical centre owing to the efforts of T M A Pai in the 60s.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =32.8"],["febhigh =33"],["marhigh =33.5"],["aprhigh =34"],["mayhigh =33.3"],["junhigh =29.7"],["julhigh =28.2"],["aughigh =28.4"],["sephigh =29.5"],["octhigh =30.9"],["novhigh =32.3"],["dechigh =32.8"],["janlow =20.8"],["feblow =21.8"],["marlow =23.6"],["aprlow =25"],["maylow =25.1"],["junlow =23.4"],["jullow =22.9"],["auglow =23"],["seplow =23.1"],["octlow =23.1"],["novlow =22.4"],["declow =21.2"],["janprecip ="],["febprecip ="],["marprecip ="],["aprprecip =30"],["mayprecip =150"],["junprecip =940"],["julprecip =980"],["augprecip =590"],["sepprecip =260"],["octprecip =200"],["novprecip =70"],["decprecip =10"],["jansnow ="],["febsnow ="],["marsnow ="],["aprsnow ="],["maysnow ="],["junsnow ="],["julsnow ="],["augsnow ="],["sepsnow ="],["octsnow ="],["novsnow ="],["decsnow ="],["jansun ="],["febsun ="],["marsun ="],["aprsun ="],["maysun ="],["junsun ="],["julsun ="],["augsun ="],["sepsun ="],["octsun ="],["novsun ="],["decsun ="],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description ="]]},"\nThe weather is fairly equable throughout the year, due to the nearby Arabian sea.

The Krishna Matha (or Mutt) was established by Madhvacharya in the 13th century. This is a complex of temples and monasteries located near the Madhva Sarovara, or Madhvacharya's pond. Madhva Sarovara has a \"mantapa\" or canopy at its centre, and the pond is often beautifully lit. Bathing at the Sarovara may or may not be possible. Inquire before taking the plunge.\n\nThe main temple itself is constructed in the architectural style typical in Kerala and Dakshina Kannada, with multiple layers around the inner sanctum sanctorum, with no massive sikhara over it as is found elsewhere in South India. There are shrines to subordinate deities including Garuda and Hanuman. On special occasions, the temple area is beautifully decorated with flowers and lamps.\n\nThe unusual feature of this temple is that the statue faces west, and away from the devotees. The reason for this, apparently, is that a lower-caste devotee named Kanakadasa was denied entry into the temple, so he tried worshiping from a small window outside it. The Lord was so pleased at his devotion that He turned around to face the window. The window is now known as Kanakana kindi, or Kanakadasa's window. Look for a massive Gopura (or tower) that has since been built over this window.\n\nRemember to take the blessings of the temple elephant located outside the temple. To enter the temple, men have to take off their shirts and vests. Offerings can be made and \"prasadam\" can be bought inside. The temple offers free lunch to everyone at three dining halls, or Bhojana Shaalas.\n\nOutside the temple is the \"Ratha beedi\", or \"chariot street\". On major festive occasions such as the \"Paryaya\", the deity is taken in procession in temple chariots. The chariots themselves are usually stationed at Ratha beedi most times. All around the Ratha beedi are the headquarters of the 8 mathas, or Ashtamathas. These mathas are places of worship in their own right. There are other temples located around the area. In addition, Gita Mandira and the Rajangana, where cultural programmes and discourses held, located a short walk away.

He also had rivals who once tried to poison his food. But because he always offered his food to his god before consuming it, they effectively ended up offering poison to the deity. When said rivals realized their folly, they rushed to Vadiraja and asked for forgiveness and asked how they could make amends. Vadiraja, through his supernatural powers, gave them a few seeds of eggplant and asked them to plant them in Matti, a village near Udupi. The resulting variety of eggplant would be free of all \"poison\" - i.e. it would have a mild taste and be easy on the stomach. To this day, the variety of eggplant grown in Matti, known as Matti Gulla, is famous for these properties."]]},"\n\nThe vegetarian cuisine of Udupi is famous all over India and among Indians abroad. For this reputation, it must thank the Sri Krishna temple and its traditions. The temple offers free food to everyone who wants to partake of it. The cooks have traditionally been the Brahmins belonging to the Shivalli sect, who, over the centuries, have perfected the art of cooking that adheres to \"Satvik\" principles. This requires not just vegetarianism but also the avoidance of onion and garlic, as these are said to excite the baser senses. In spite of these limitations, the food of Udupi tastes great, with subtle flavours.\n\nWhile the eat section of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karavali#eat"],["Karavali"]]}," article more than adequately covers the cuisine you are likely to encounter here, Udupi has some items of food that are unique to the place. One of them  is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Matti Gulla"]}," (see infobox) a variant of eggplant. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ibbulle"]},", a kind of musk melon is a speciality here.

The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Udupi Restaurants"]}," came up in Mumbai to cater to this group of people. Very soon, these eateries, serving cheap, nutritious and vegetarian food became very popular and spread all over India.
