Even so, its central location may make it a very economical home base for tourists and commuters, and its panoramic views of the Bay alone are worth the side trip for visitors.\n\nOn paper, the landscape of Hayward sounds nearly perfect.  Hayward boasts of a central bay shoreline, a quaint city center with a small town feel in the city flatlands, hills which overlook the bay, and a hub of highways that connect everywhere in the bay area to the inland areas of California.  Unfortunately the shoreline is mostly filled with warehouses and marshland, and the city center is slightly run down, although it is slowly being renovated.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nAs is the case in most of California, you will find it easiest to get to and around Hayward by car.  That being said, there are two BART stops in Hayward, including one in the center of town which is in walking distance to many shops, restaurants, the public library and city hall.  There are buses run by AC Transit, but these do not go to all parts of Hayward.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nHayward does have a lot of traffic in the Downtown area and on Highways. Hayward has several bus systems that serve the city. AC Transit and All Nighter Bus Network provide bus service and Union City Transit provides service in the Southern Hayward Area along the Union City Border. SamTrans srevice was discontinued in 1999. The HillHopper Bus System provides service to CSUEB. BART Has two stations (Downtown, South Hayward) with BayFair and Castro Valley BART stations nearby. Hayward has an Amtark station in the Burbank District.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Meek Mansion (Hayward, CA).JPG"],["thumb"],["Meek Mansion, managed by the Hayward Area Historical Society, located just outside the city."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Hayward Area Historical Society & Museum & Gift Shop"]}," +1 510-581-0223, museum and gift shop closed until new facilities are opened up.

In the wake of the Gold Rush, former miners and new immigrants established homes and businesses, planted orchards and raised livestock setting down roots that grew into communities known for their diverse population, varied industry, and suburban living. The Hayward Area Historical Society tells the region's story at its downtown museum (closed until a new location is opened) and through tours of historic sites.
