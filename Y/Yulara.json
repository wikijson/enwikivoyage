It was constructed in the 1980s and is just outside the national park boundaries.\n\nIn 2010 the resort was purchased by the Indigenous Land Council who plan to have 50% of the Resorts workforce made up of Indigenous people by 2018.\n\nMost people at Yulara would stay one or two nights, and many are on tours.  Finding people who spend a week is unusual.  The township tends to be very quiet during times when the tours are viewing the rock.

The roads connecting Yulara, Uluru and Kata Tjuta are all paved and maintained, so there's no real challenge to the driving. Car rental is the best option for independent travelers.

There is also another look out in the middle of Yulara Drive, called the Imalung Lookout.  \n\nAdditionally there is a lookout in the coach campground area, should you be travelling on a coach camping tour.  This gives a view of the resort, as well as Uluru and Kata Tjuta.\n\nFor an idea of the wildlife in the National Park, visit the Visitors Centre, located next door to the Desert Gardens Hotel.  \n\nOf course, the main thing to do is to get out to Uluru and Kata Tjuta, but the lookouts in the resort tend to be forgotten about - and at sunrise and sunset they have a different aspect for a photo.\n\nYou might also want to see ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mount Conner"]},", a plateau frequently mistaken for Ayers Rock by travelers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nArrangements can be made for ",{"type":"'''","value":["helicopter tours"]}," of the area, ranging from quick, ten minute buzzes of Uluru to longer rides taking in Kata Tjuta and King's Canyon as well.

Champagne (or beer, upon request) are served while the sun goes down over Uluru or Kata Tjuta and the inevitable didgeridoo plays. The clean, elegant dining area is lit by torches and table lamps. The food is served buffet-style, but it's cooked with the attention of a gourmet chef (considering the circumstances). Between the main course and dessert, an astronomer talks about the stars that are out that night, and telescopes are available afterward. There is also a bonfire.
