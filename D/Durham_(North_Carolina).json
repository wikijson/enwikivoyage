A city of just over 200,000, Durham's early wealth was built on tobacco and textiles, with a vibrant African-American community that once made the city a center for Black culture.\n\nThese days, the tobacco warehouses and textile mills sit empty or have been converted to other uses, as Durham has taken on a different identity; best known now as the home of Duke University, a thriving health care and high tech industry has taken root in Durham. The city has also emerged as a cultural center for the region, with a lively theater scene and a trendy arts community that has begun to change Durham's gritty image. And while the city lacks the political clout of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Raleigh"]]}," or the college town atmosphere of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chapel Hill"]]},", some of the Triangle's most interesting and exciting attractions are to be found here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nDurham owes much of its wealth and history to tobacco.  Through the second half of the 19th Century, Washington Duke and his family grew from a single farm into American Tobacco, which controlled 90% of all cigarette production for the United States.  The Duke family donated money to Trinity College, which in 1924 was renamed Duke University.\n\nIn the early 20th Century, North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Mechanics & Farmers Bank, and Mutual Savings & Loan were founded in Durham by African-Americans.  These prominent companies drew more African-American investment to Durham, to the point that Durham's Parrish Street neighborhood became known as \"Black Wall Street.\"  NC Mutual Life continues to this day as the oldest and largest African-American-owned life insurance company in the nation and as a visible part of the Durham skyline.\n\nThe last cigarette rolled out of Durham in 2000.  Many of the old factory and warehouse structures have been converted into housing, retail, restaurant and office spaces.  The city has changed its motto from \"City of Tobacco\" to \"City of Medicine,\" based on the high concentration of medical practitioners and researchers at Duke and in Research Triangle Park, the Durham County special tax district formed in 1959 to attract high-tech jobs to the area.\n\nDurham has a liberal trendy arts culture.  It is an eclectic blend of the high class with an unusual concentration of four star restaurants (part owing to a strange bit of local family history) to trendy cafés on 9th Street, the independent bookstore \"the Regulator\" which draws famed authors from former secretary of state Madeline Albright to expert on everything John Hodgeman.  You'll find old hippies, bikers and families in generally happy co-existence.  The area has a very active gay community which stages both a famed regional film festival and an annual pride march.
