Because of Iowa's early caucus date the city is also a hotbed of political dreams and discourse every four years when presidential candidates tour the state and have multiple debates within the city.\n\nThe meaning of 'Des Moines' itself is not clear as local Native Americans, the Moingona, had already been using a term (which meant 'river of the mounds') due to the number of burial mounds which were popular in the area.  French Trappist Monks (Moines de la Trappe) called their settlement areas at the mouth of the Des Moines River 'La Riviere des Moines' which, in English, translates to 'the river of the monks.' \"De Moyn,\" which means \"middle,\" may have been used on the map of explorer Jacques Marquette to help others locate the Des Moines River-area (equidistant between the larger Mississippi and Missouri rivers).  \"Des Moines,\" today pronounced \"duh MOIN,\" is located at the junction of the Des Moines River and the Raccoon River.\n\nFort Des Moines was settled in 1843 by a group of dragoons from the Sac and Fox Agency (Fort Sanford) led by Captain James Allen.  Originally, Allen was going to name the area Fort Raccoon but was instructed by the War Department to use the name Fort Des Moines.  In 1846, the Fort dissolved and the city was officially created.\n\nIn 2010, U.S. Census Bureau data estimated the ",{"type":"'''","value":["population"]}," of Des Moines proper to be at 203,433;  the metro area has more than 500,000 residents.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh =   29"],["febhigh =   35"],["marhigh =   48"],["aprhigh =   61"],["mayhigh =   72"],["junhigh =   82"],["julhigh =   86"],["aughigh =   84"],["sephigh =   76"],["octhigh =   64"],["novhigh =   47"],["dechigh =   33"],["janlow =   12"],["feblow =   18"],["marlow =   29"],["aprlow =   40"],["maylow =   51"],["junlow =   61"],["jullow =   66"],["auglow =   64"],["seplow =   54"],["octlow =   42"],["novlow =   29"],["declow =   17"],["janprecip =  1.0"],["febprecip =  1.2"],["marprecip =  2.2"],["aprprecip =  3.6"],["mayprecip =  4.3"],["junprecip =  4.6"],["julprecip =  4.2"],["augprecip =  4.5"],["sepprecip =  3.2"],["octprecip =  2.6"],["novprecip =  2.1"],["decprecip =  1.3"]]},"\n\nDue in part to the moist and rich soils that make Iowa an agricultural powerhouse, summers are filled with very humid air.

Visitors who park their cars should be prepared in case their car is \"snowed in\" by snow removal trucks.  Also, strict attention to parking rules and snow emergencies is recommended to avoid being towed away at the car owner's expense.  During the winter months, a snow brush, ice scraper, and plenty of windshield washer fluid is essential, and many natives opt to carry a shovel, some sand, and a bag of ice melt\/road salt in the trunk just in case.\n\nGasoline is reasonably cheap in the Des Moines area, partially from subsidies afforded to ",{"type":"'''","value":["ethanol"]}," which is widely available at most gas stations to travelers.  The most popular mixture, 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, is generally considered safe for newer autos (not to be confused with 85% ethanol\/15% gasoline blend).  Ethanol and its usage can stir up quite a debate even in the corn-loving state of Iowa.\n\nThe Des Moines River serves as the marker for street names having the prefix \"East\" or not (and occasionally \"West\" when on the western side). This is especially important for streets running north-south. \"1st Ave\" would be on the west side of the river, E 1st Ave the eastern side and are thus completely different streets. Streets running east-west and which exist on both sides of the river typically have an \"East\" prefix if east of the river.  There are some \"West\" prefixes for those on the other side of the river but this is less common.  Perhaps more confusing, there are streets which lie on both sides of the river, such as Grand Ave, which is \"E Grand Ave\" east of the river but simply \"Grand Ave\" west of the river; yet \"E University Ave\" is officially named \"W University Ave\" when on the western side of the river.  Unlike the north-south streets, it is possible to arrive at your destination by simply continuing east or west—depending on your final destination.  The demarcation for \"SE\" and \"SW\" prefixes is a bit more ambiguous but would certainly refer to a street south of Grand Ave\/E Grand Ave and either the western or eastern side of the river. For most part, \"NW\" refers to streets west of the river and \"NE\" east of it, but not always so.  Additionally, there is no standard reference point for determining when a street gains a \"NW\" or \"NE\" prefix.\n\nDowntown has several one-way streets to ease traffic flow during rush hours.
