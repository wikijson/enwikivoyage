The Stone Circles of Senegambia (now World Heritage Sites) are believed to date back to 3 BC. Not a lot is known about the earliest civilizations, but there were many paleolithic and neolithic civilizations around the Senegal River.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tekrur Kingdom"]}," (Tekrour), formed around the Senegal River in Futa Toro (Fouta Toro), is one of the earliest recorded black kingdoms. Although the exact formation date is unknown, historians believe it began in the early 9th century, around the same time as the Ghana Empire formed in the east. Parts of eastern Senegal were ruled by the Ghana Empire as it expanded but Tekrur was more concentrated in Senegal(although the southern regions were inhabited by ancestors of the Wolof). It was during Tekrur rule that Islam came to Senegal in the 11th century from the Almoravids in the North. The Tekrur rulers first converted to Islam and most of the kingdom followed soon after. After the Almoravids attacked the Ghanaian Empire, it slowly lost power and influence, giving rise to the Mali Empire in 1235.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wolof Empire"]}," (Djolof) was formed in the 13th century from many smaller states to the south of Tekrur as a tributary state of the Mali Empire. Unlike their northern neighbors, they were not converted to Islam; they were animists. The Tekrur Kingdom was weak by this time, so the rising Wolof and Mali Empires excised heavy influence over them (The Mali Empire also considered Tekrur to be a tributary state). The Wolof Empire obtained full independence from Mali in 1360 with its capital at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Linguère"]]}," and overtook territories to the south around the Gambia and established many groups as vassals, such as the Sine Kingdom in 1400. The Wolof Empire became quite powerful and at the height of its rule saw the arrival of the Portuguese.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Portuguese Arrival and Fall of Wolof Empire"]},"\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Senegal at Goree Island in 1444. They were searching for a new spice route to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," but soon established ports in Goree and on the Cap-Vert Peninsula (present-day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dakar"]]},"). The Wolof and Portuguese established trade relations, providing wealth to the empire. Europeans payed good money for war captives (which they sent off as slaves), and the natives were able to bring the slaves to them so that they didn't have to go inland. Senegal was one of the most profitable ports early on in the slave trading business and the strong Wolof were able to sell many captives from weaker regions. Their tributary, the Sine Kingdom, was also quite actively involved in selling captives to the Portuguese. Members of the Waalo Kingdom (a Wolof vassal state) were commonly the victims of captive raids. Sometimes the Europeans incited wars in order to ensure more captives while in other cases, the money they payed was enough incentive for natives to start conflicts just to produce slaves. \n\nWhile profits were great in the beginning, the Atlantic slave trade soon crippled the empire as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cayor Kingdom"]}," separated from the Wolof in 1549 and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sine Kingdom"]}," became independent in 1550, cutting the Wolof off from the coast and from trade and business with the Portuguese. Along with internal problems, the Wolof were also plagued by outside problems. As a former tributary state of the Mali Empire, the Wolof maintained strong ties with Mali through trade with the empire, but as the Songhai grew stronger, they seized much of Mali's territory, further isolating the Wolof. Furthermore, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Denianke Kingdom"]}," (Denanke) had taken over territories to the north, including Takrur, and had attacked the Wolof's northern territories, which they struggled to maintain. By 1600, the Wolof Empire had completely disbanded, although one of the territories remained a Wolof state.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["French Conquest"]},"\nThe location and success of trade in Senegal made it a hot commodity among Europeans.

The Waalo Kingdom existed around the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint-Louis"]]}," trading post, so they had a treaty with the French in which the French would pay them for goods and they would provide protection for the traders.
