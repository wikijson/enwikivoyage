If searching for a fun club, bar or restaurant feel encouraged to walk through downtown Stamford at night especially Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The area of the most bars is centered roughly around Columbus park but there are many more popular places to drink. The area bordered by Forest Street to the north, Grove Street to the east, Washington Boulevard to the west, and Tresser boulevard to the south is a very safe area to wander and contains much of Stamford nightlife. Be careful of leaving this area however as some of the streets bordering Stamford downtown can be dangerous especially at night. Avoid hanging around the St. Johns Towers (the three large cylinder towers on Tresser Boulevard.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Courtyard Stamford Downtown"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/marriott.com\/property\/propertypage\/STFCY"],["email="],["address=275 Summer St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 203 358-8822"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 203 358-8811"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Fairfield Inn Stamford Greenwich"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/marriott.com\/property\/propertypage\/STFFI"],["email="],["address=135 Harvard Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 203 357-7100"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 203 358-9332"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Sheraton Stamford Hotel"],["url=http:\/\/www.sheratonstamford.com"],["email="],["address=700 E Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 203 358-8400"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 203 358-8872"],["hours="],["price=Affordable"],["checkin=3PM"],["checkout=12PM"],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Marriott Stamford Hotel & Spa"],["url=http:\/\/www.marriottstamford.com"],["email="],["address=243 Tresser Blvd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 203-357-9555"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=The Stamford Plaza Hotel and Conference Center"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.stamfordplazahotel.com\/Hotel_Special_Offers"],["email="],["address=2701 Summer St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 203 359-1300"],["tollfree=+1-877-604-6072 or +1-866-716-8120"],["fax=+1 203 348-7937"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=The Stamford Marriott"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.marriottstamford.com"],["email="],["address=243 Tresser Blvd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Offers 500 guest rooms and six suites covering 17 floors, with great views of Long Island Sound, downtown Stamford, and the Manhattan skyline.

However caution must be used in some parts of Stamford, especially traveling past public housing projects. Walking the street is where you will encounter the most danger; avoid certain streets on the East Side (Custer Street, Ursula Place, Sections of Cove Road.), the West Side (Connecticut Avenue, Merrel Avenue, Spruce Street), as well as most of the Waterside (bordered by I-95 on the north, the Greenwich\/Stamford border to the west and the Long Island Sound to the south and east; main avenue is Southfield Ave) and South End neighborhoods (The South End is bordered by I-95 to the north, and Long Island Sound to the east, west, and south; main avenue is Canal Street). Although Stamford is rapidly gentrifying, gangs and organized crime have long established roots in Stamford. Use the same caution as one would use in any city especially faced with a violent confrontation or when engaging in illicit activities. Stamford’s homeless population is not large but can be quite aggressive. Be careful of how you carry yourself; in Stamford a quick word might be more effective then simply ignoring a request. Avoid the McDonald's by the main library downtown, especially at night. A lot of gangs and undesirables hang out at the McDonald's as well as a healthy group of aggressive homeless. There are plenty of other (safer) dining options in the area. Also Shippan has a lot of young hooligans roaming around at night. Some may get violent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},"- The primary reason for Stamford development was its proximity to NYC. A 30-minute drive down I95 or the Merrit Parkway will take you to Nyc. Also a 45 minute express train, and a 75 minute local train will take you there and back for 18 dollars. Free parking for the train station is provided at a commuter lot adjacent to I95 and there is slightly expensive pay parking lot directly across the street from the train station. Taking the train into Grand Central provides you access to the NYC transit system and you can use that to venture to any part of the city for about $2.50 a trip.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bridgeport (Connecticut)"],["Bridgeport"]]},"- Bridgeport is a cheaper alternative to visiting New York City. Bridgeport is only roughly(depending on traffic) a 20 minute drive down I-95 or the Merrit parkway and a 30 minute train ride.
