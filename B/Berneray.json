It is joined to the larger island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Uist"]]}," by a short double-track road causeway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nBerneray has a population of 137 (as of June 2010) which has been mostly rising for the previous three years.\n\nMost people live on the east coast in the spread out settlements of Pol An Nor, Backhill, Ruisgarry and Sandhill. There is also a settlement in the center of the island known as Borve.\n\nThere is strong evidence that points to Berneray being inhabited since the Bronze Age and possibly before. The island is scattered with ancient sacred sites, stone circles, signs of Viking inhabitation and historical buildings, some several centuries old.\n\nCrofting (family-based farming on a small area of land, usually in a non-intensive manner) and fishing are the mainstays of the economy, although tourism, information and media services also provide income to a number of households.\n\nDue to the total lack of industrialization most visitors notice that most of the \"noise\" on Berneray is natural — waves, seals, geese and birds. Often the only audible human-made noise is the bell on the ferry that leaves the south of the island and crosses the Sound of Harris.\n\nBerneray never becomes crowded or overrun with tourists due to the limited number of passengers that flights to the Outer Hebrides can take, as well as the high cost of bringing a vehicle over from the mainland on a ferry.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Berneray Beach Pabbay.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The West Beach, the longest beach on the island"]]},"\nApart from Boreray (population: 1), Berneray is the only inhabited island in the Sound of Harris, with an area of 10.1 square kilometers (2496 acres). Berneray rises to a height of 305 feet (93 m) at Beinn Shleibhe (otherwise known as Ben Leva or Moor Hill) and 278 feet (85 m) at Borve Hill.\n\nA key feature of Berneray is its ",{"type":"'''","value":["machair"]},", an area of land next to beaches and shorelines that has been fertilized over time by crushed shells and other minerals. Traditional crofting practice, which involves summer agriculture using seaweed together with dung from winter grazing animals as natural fertilizer, has, over time, bound together and stabilized the machair. In the summer months the fertile soil of the machair supports a spectacular and colourful array of wild flowers and plants.\n\nBerneray is perhaps best known for its beaches. The famous west beach is a three-mile unspoilt, deserted crescent of sand. The east beach, at the end of which sits the Youth Hostel, is also spectacular, as are the little coves and beaches on the south side. All of these are good locations for a picnic, and for spotting otters and other sea life.\n\nEven in the middle of summer it is very rare to see more than a few people on any stretch of Berneray beach. The Lonely Planet Guide to Scotland (2004) said \"The superb beaches of western Berneray are unparalleled in Scotland.\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe summer months of June to August have exceptionally long days (the latitude is comparable to the most populated regions of Scandinavia or Alaska), and also tend to be warmer. Due to its location, Berneray tends to have favoured warm air flows; the temperature very rarely goes below freezing, and snow occurs at most for one or two days per year.\n\nHowever, sun and rain are possible at any time of the year.  The months of April to May and September to October are favoured by many travellers. The days are still quite long and the weather is often excellent (better than the summer for the last two years).\n\nDo not discount the winter, which has its attractions, for visiting. Key among them are the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Lights"]]},", a dazzling night-time display of shimmering curtains of different coloured light that stretches across the sky.

It is possible to travel to several other islands connected by causeway and back in the same day from Berneray, thus enabling people to visit some of the many beaches. The latest timetables can be obtained from the Youth Hostel and the Ardmaree Store; however the bus drivers are very helpful and will offer detailed local sightseeing and travelling advice.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nBoat skippers can sail around the shallow waters of Berneray, and take shelter in the confusingly named Bays Loch. This is actually part of the sea (not a true Scottish Loch), but is relatively sheltered on most sides. On the east side of Bays Loch is the fishing harbour, with facilities such as a toilet and shower block, moorings, and a lifting crane. The exact location of the harbour is latitude 57 degrees 42m 50s, and longitude -7 degrees 10m 11s.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Berneray causeway (hazelisles).jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["right"],["The causeway to North Uist, with \"otters crossing\" sign."]]},"\n\nBerneray is some 2 miles wide and 3 miles long. There is a road along the east side of the island, and another through the centre and across the machair. These and the roads approaching Berneray are mostly single-track with occasional passing areas. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Driving"]}," is easy, with very little traffic. The main obstacle are sheep that run into the middle of the road, and the occasional otter crossing.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Walking"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["cycling"]}," are popular ways of getting around. There is a circular path around much of the island that is clearly signposted with blue waymarker signs. Alternately, a popular walk is to follow the shoreline around the island, which takes around 5 hours. Most of the walk is on beaches. There may be slightly boggy areas of land after rain, so waterproof footwear is recommended. However, there are no dangerous areas of land; mud is the walkers greatest problem.\n\nThe hills of Berneray are relatively small, each taking about 15 minutes to walk up by a reasonably fit person. Despite their height, the views from the top are truly spectacular; on a clear day, it is possible to see up to 30 other islands, including St Kilda, and many other beaches.\n\nThere are no dangerous or poisonous animals on Berneray. Sheepdogs may growl at passing people, but are generally harmless. Many people on Berneray keep cats, which are friendly.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cycles for hire"]}," are available from Burnside Croft ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.burnsidecroft.biz\/"]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Alda Taxis"]},", in Lochmaddy, (",{"type":"''","value":["10 miles away"]},"), tel: +44 1876 500 215, provide a cheap taxi service.

The machair is ploughed in rotation, giving a patchwork of crops and fallow of different ages which supports a wide range of flowers. Berneray has a particularly fine machair, a result of careful stewardship by the island’s crofters... and helped by the absence of rabbits.\n\nThe crofting practices also encourage a wide array of wildlife on Berneray. On early summer evenings you can sometimes hear snipe drumming and even the rasp of a corncrake. Mute swans can be seen on Loch Brusda and greylag geese are common. In the winter they are joined by barnacle and a few brent geese. Ravens and buzzards are often seen.\n\nGolden eagles and hen harriers are rarer sights, usually in the winter. Wading birds on the shore include redshanks, sanderlings, turnstones, oyster catchers, dunlin, curlews, whimbrels, ringed plovers and herons.\n\nFurther out, around the shores of Berneray, are mallards, eiders, red-breasted mergansers, and, more rarely, black-throated and great northern divers. Shags and cormorants fish in the seas around Berneray throughout the year, and in summer you can see gannets diving. Common seals often congregate at low tide on the rocks in Bays Loch and can often be seen from the parking area a little way beyond the Post Office or by taking a boat trip out into the bay.\n\nGrey seals, which are larger and can be distinguished by the long 'roman' noses, also haul out there occasionally, but are more common off the West Beach. Though the otters of Berneray are out during the day more often than on the mainland they are still elusive, and it takes patience and luck to see one.\n\nCrotal, or lichen, growing on the rocks was used to dye wool for the Harris Tweed industry, giving a rich brown or tan colour. Many hues were made from other plants, some growing wild on Berneray, before the advent of bought dyes.\n\nThere is also anecdotal evidence to suggest that Great White Sharks sometimes visit these waters. The temperatures are similar to those of Cape Town and South Australia and in seals they have a preferred food source.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Remains"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Old graveyard on Berneray.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The old graveyard on the south side of Ben Leva."]]},"\n\nThere are many visible historical and archaeological remains on Berneray. These stem from the fact that the island has been populated for over 5,000 years by a number of native and invading races, due to the fertile lands.\n\nOlder historical features include ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cnoc Na Greine"]}," (Hillock of the Sun), a circle of stones on one hilltop that was the supposed center of pre-Christian sun worship, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cidhe mor Mhicleoid"]}," (Big Quay of MacLeod), a mostly submerged Viking pier close to the Youth Hostel. Near the south of the island is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beinn a'Chlaidh"]}," (Hill of the Graveyard), a pagan site with a standing stone eight feet in height. A chapel dedicated to St. Columba was built on the site in the 6th century and later plundered by the Vikings.\n\nTo the west of the standing stone is ",{"type":"'''","value":["A'Chiste Chloiche"]},", the remains of a chambered cairn from the Bronze Age where kings were buried with their Ulaidh (treasure). 125 yards to the southwest of the standing stone is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Leac an Righ"]}," (Stone of the King). This is a stone with the imprint of a human foot and inscriptions similar to the stone at Dunadd on mainland Scotland where kings were crowned.\n\nOn the machair are a collection of large stones. These were used in trials held by the Vikings; one of the stones is known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["chairstone"]},", and opposite is another where archaeologists speculate that the accused presented his case. Strange curvatures of the land nearby indicate possible sites of Viking burials, as yet unexplored.\n\nTo the west, nearer the beach, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Uaigh an Innseanaich"]}," (Grave of the Indian). In 1918 a drowned man was washed ashore on the West Beach. He was buried nearby on the machair, a stone placed at his head and feet, but the exact location has now silted over.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cill Aiseam"]},", the churchyard of St Asaph (a 7th-century British bishop and follower of St Kentigern) can be located near to the youth hostel.

Also nearby is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Clach nan Coinnlean"]}," (Stone of the Candles); coffins were rested on this stone, on their way to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cladh a'Chambuir"]},", the old cemetery dramatically set on the south side of Ben Leva.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Armoury"]}," is a deserted building and the birthplace of Sir Rory Mor (Norman MacLeod), a scholar who fought at the battle of Worcester. The Latin plaque above the doorway reads: \"Hic natus est ille illustris Normanus MacLeod de Berneray eques auratus\".\n\nThe most well-known is probably the site of the house where the giant ",{"type":"'''","value":["Angus MacAskill"]}," was raised. This is on the south coast of Berneray; follow the machair road to the end and walk about half a mile further till you come to the monument. Giant MacAskill, (Angus Mor MacAskill, (1825-August 8, 1863) was known as the world's largest \"true\" giant (normal proportions, no growth abnormalities), reaching a height of 7 ft 9 in. The 1981 ",{"type":"''","value":["Guinness Book of World Records"]}," lists Angus as the tallest natural giant who ever lived, the strongest man who ever lived, and the man having the largest chest measurements of any non-obese man (80 inches). Many descendants of his family still live on the island and are noticeably tall people.\n\nOn the extreme southwest point of the island, at the end of the West Beach, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Braighe na Ceilp"]}," (Breastwork of the Kelp). Just above the shoreline stones have been evenly settled into the ground rectangulary to support the seaweed for drying and burning. This was a thriving industry for some years and, as a result of immigration, the population increased to 712 in 1841. However, by 1851 it had declined to 410, due to evictions and the cessation of the kelp industry. Nearby is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cnoc nan Claigeann"]}," (Hillock of the Heads), an unnatural rise probably built by ancient Celts who collected heads of invaders. The ruins of a shepherd's bothy stands on the summit.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Berneray Houses.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Restored blackhouses.

These were generally built with double  dry-stone walls packed with earth and wooden rafters covered with a turf roof, although reed thatch was occasionally used as the roofing material. The floor was usually flagstones or packed earth and there was a central hearth for the fire. The blackhouse was used to accommodate livestock as well as people, animals at one end and people at the other with a partition in between. There was no chimney for the smoke to escape; instead, the smoke made its way through the roof. The structures, though requiring constant maintenance, were often extremely sturdy in order to survive winter storms. After around 1850, houses were built with single walls and were known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["taighean geala"]}," or white houses.\n\nAs people moved into more modern dwellings with conveniences such as running water and central heating, the blackhouse tended to go out of use, and many ruined or roofless examples can be seen around Berneray. However, blackhouses are increasingly being restored for habitation.\n\nThe most visible signs of previous life are the parallel lines that turn around the sides of some of the hills. These are called ",{"type":"'''","value":["lazybeds"]},", and were the strips where potatoes were planted in the 18th and 19th centuries to feed the much larger populations of the times.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Nearby islands"]},"\n\nBerneray can be used as a base for exploring nearby small, unpopulated islands by boat. Many of these islands have old ruins and pleasant beaches, ideal for non-exerting walking and picnics. Boat trips are available at the fishing harbour; ask there or examine the latest notices on the island noticeboard. Trips are weather dependent, and prices are negotiated with the boat owner\/skipper. As a guide, a boat full of people going to an island such as Pabbay for a whole day may cost around £120.
