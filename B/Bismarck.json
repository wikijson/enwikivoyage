The Elbow Room can be a veritable local high school reunion on some weekend nights.\n\nIf you like a variety of beers, try O'Briens, Sport's Page, or Peacock Alley.\n\nThe hangout for politicians when the state legislature is in session is the Peacock Alley Bar, located in the historic Patterson Hotel building in downtown Bismarck.  Government-types have been calling the \"Peacock\" their after-hours home for more than half a century.  The regular crowd includes a variety ranging from 20-somethings to middle-aged downtown business folk, generally people that appreciate the atmosphere, good conversation, and variety of libations the location has provided since first opening in 1911.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Steep Me"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Downtown Bismarck by the Kirkwood Mall."],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A tea shop that is a daily stop for locals.
