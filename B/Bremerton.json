A new government center, which provides combined governmental services in a single building, anchors the town's revitalized core.\n\nAlready contributing to the downtown revitalization are art galleries, the Admiral Theatre, museums and many quaint shops and restaurants.\n\nBremerton is a safe, environmentally clean community within an hour's ferry ride from downtown Seattle where you can visit the Navy destroyer Turner Joy, stroll along a delightful block-long waterfront promenade and check out the new Kitsap Conference Center Plaza with its fascinating fountains, and enjoy a bounty of seasonal community events and concerts.\n\nDowntown has three museums, in one block, within walking distance of the ferries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nNative American Salish people lived comfortably in the Puget Sound area navigating the local waterways in well made cedar canoes for thousands of years before 1792 when Captain George Vancouver 'discovered' the area, named it after one of his officers and declared the area for Great Briton.\n\nOnce the Washington Territory was established in 1853, the U.S. government began signing treaties with area tribes to acquire their lands. The Suquamish people ceded most of their land around the Kitsap Peninsula to the United States and logging came into the area in full force. The areas once impassible thick forests gave way to farms, towns and industry as lumber was shipped off to areas such as San Francisco or burned as fuel for the growing fleet of boats known as the Mosquito Fleet. In 1888, William Bremer, a German immigrant from a wealthy banking family, traveled by boat from Seattle and purchased land that is now Bremerton from a local logger.\n\nIn 1891, Bremer negotiated with Lt. A.B. Wyckoff to sell 190 acres to the U.S. Navy for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, still a major employer. Bremer platted the town around the Navy's property and gave it his name. He opened businesses to support the Navy's activities.\n\nThe City of Bremerton was incorporated in 1901. The Bremerton Chamber of Commerce was incorporated in 1928 with William Gates, Sr., grandfather of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, as treasurer.\n\nThe town exploded in size during World War I and II, when more than 40,000 workers arrived to work at the shipyard. Since then fortunes have been through boom and bust and the town is now revitalizing the downtown area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nMain Highways to Bremerton are WA Highway 3 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shelton (Washington)"],["Shelton"]]},", north through the county to the Hood Canal Bridge near the northern tip of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kitsap Peninsula"]]},".
