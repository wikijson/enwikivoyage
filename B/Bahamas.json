The cheapest hotels start at around US$ 70, and most hotels cost US$200-300\/night, with the very best resorts easily pushing up above US$500. Deals may be available in the summer off-season though.\n\nBe aware the Bahamas charge a \"",{"type":"'''","value":["Service Fee or Resort Fee"]},"\" to every person staying overnight.

This is an addition to the rate of the room and is not optional and cannot be waived.

Out of the 210 primary schools run in the country, 158 are operated by the government.  The remaining 52 schools are operated by private owners. Higher education is also offered by many non-Bahamian colleges in the country.\n\nThe College of the Bahamas is the main institution that offers post secondary education in the country with several schools including and undergraduate business school, an undergraduate social science.  Other tertiary educational institutions in the country include Success Training College, Bahamas Technical and Vocational Institute and Nova Southeastern University. The University of The West Indies also has a campus in the Bahamas.\n\nThere are also some international universities that offer programs in the country such as the University of Miami's MBA programme.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nIn most cases non-citizens may not work within The Bahamas. There are exceptions for those possessing skills not available from a Bahamian, as well as migrants of Creole descent who may or may not be in the Bahamas legally. The employer must show legitimate proof of strenuous searching for a suitable Bahamian prior to applying for a work permit for the foreign candidate. However any ordinary position that does not require any specialized skills will not readily qualify as an employment opportunity for a foreigner. Should a foreign nation apply for a position as a maid or anything along that line of employment, they would definitely be denied the occupation. This line of employment shows no necessary skills that a Bahamian could not possess.\n\nTourism is the main industry followed by banking.\n\n50 percent of the national GDP is generated by tourism.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nBy the middle of the year 2007, the country had already recorded 42 murders.

In 2011 the Commissioner of the Royal Bahamas Police Force stated that the vast majority of murder victims in New Providence (Nassau), were already well known to police. A report done by an international body stated that The Bahamas ranks amongst the top for crimes committed against women. However, to maintain good local and international relations, the police have increased their presence and the judicial system vowed to bring about \"swift justice\".\n\nVisitors should exercise caution and good judgment when visiting The Bahamas.

Persons violating Bahamian laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.
