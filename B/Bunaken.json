By and large though, the co-operation between national and local government authorities, conservation groups, business owners and local communities has been very successful here. This has led many to cite Bunaken as a model example of how Indonesia should be preserving its natural marine treasures.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nBunaken was formally established as a national marine park in 1991. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bunaken Mangrove Coast.JPG"],["thumb"],["240px"],["Mangroves on the east coast of Bunaken"]]},"\n\nThe park is famed for the clarity of its water (35m visibility is common in the summer dry season), the abundance of coral and fish, and for the precipitous \"walls\"  at some sites.  Bunaken Timur, right off the east coast of the island and featuring all of the above, is rated by many as the single best dive site in all Indonesia.\n\nIn places the water is extremely deep - 1,500 m plus.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nBunaken has a quite stunning biodiversity including:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" No less than 70 different genera of coral "]},{"type":"*","value":[" five species of sea turtle"]},{"type":"*","value":[" an extraordinary range of fish - 70% of all fish species that exist in the Indo-Western Pacific Ocean are found here "]},{"type":"*","value":[" white tip and black tip reef-sharks are common"]},{"type":"*","value":[" wonderful resident dugongs"]},{"type":"*","value":[" barracuda and tuna make regular appearances from more pelagic waters"]},{"type":"*","value":[" occasionally saltwater crocodiles"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nBunaken is barely a degree above the equator and thus ",{"type":"'''","value":["tropical"]},".

As proof of payment, you will receive a waterproof plastic tag that must be carried at all times. Spot checks are not uncommon by the patrol boats.\n\nThe park is managed by a multi-stakeholder board comprising of government and non-government members to include representatives of the 30,000 people who live within the boundaries of the park. Though deemed by some as not being transparent and lacking in effectiveness, the management board together with the water police have, over the years, been able to stop cyanide fishing, dynamite fishing and more recently participated in the release of 700 napoleon wrasse that had been illegally caught in and around the park. Though not perfect and certainly having room for improvement, the management board does have an important role in the conservation of the area and this could not happen without the support of all visitors in adhering to the purchase of the entrance tag.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPathways connect the various settlements around Bunaken.
