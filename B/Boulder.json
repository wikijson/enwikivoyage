What perhaps distinguishes it most from other cities of similar size in the United States, however, is its status as a mecca for serious athletes, many of whom have made their home here for the conditioning advantages of high altitude, combined with businesses, facilities, and a community that provides opportunities for serious training and competition. Even the average nine-to-five Boulderite is much more likely than the average American to be a serious climber, cyclist, runner, skier, etc., and you will see the difference as you're about town.\n\nBoulder is situated in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Front Range"]]}," region of Colorado and is virtually adjacent to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},", except for its buffer of Open Space Parks ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/joomla.ci.boulder.co.us\/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1167&Itemid=1085"]}," which border the city and provide it shelter from its growing surroundings.

It is very true, no matter what the weather, there are always people outdoors; running, biking, walking, hiking. It has a great atmosphere and beautiful sights.\n\nLiving in Boulder is very expensive. Along with being one of the most active towns in America, it is right up there with the living expense.
