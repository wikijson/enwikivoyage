Generally, the more south you go in the state, the more unlike the South it seems, and you should not expect to experience 'southern' culture everywhere, although southern culture can be found in every region of the state, it is not always the most prominent. Cities such as Tampa and Orlando offer the feel of many different cultures. There are a lot of southerners in these areas, as well as people who are not from the state (midwest, northeast), whereas Miami is unique in seeming like a cross between an American metropolis and a major Latin American city (like Caracas, Rio, or São Paulo). There are some Seminole Indian reserves and villages throughout southern Florida (namely in the Everglades) and their indigenous culture can be experienced by visiting a gift shop and browsing arts and crafts. The southernmost Florida Keys offer yet another flavor, full of the slow paced and casual atmosphere of true beach life. All in all, Florida is its own region of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]}," in its own right.\n\nThe Florida State Fair held every February near Tampa is the best event to attend to sense the varying cultures. The fairgrounds are host to a \"cracker\" village similar to the villages that were found in rural Florida in the 19th century. It hosts an exposition of counties, where each Florida county has a display and a representative to answer questions. In addition, the fair has animal displays and shows, an exhibition dedicated to citrus, various dance & cheerleading competitions, and a large selection of rides and games. A few weeks later, nearby Plant City host the Strawberry Festival, usually the last few days of February and first week of March. Plant City is the \"Strawberry Capital of the US\" and almost every food vendor at the festival offers several dishes featuring strawberries.\n\nDriving near Plant City in February and March, one can find many roadside vendors offering flats(~$10-12) and half-flats(~$5-8) of strawberries. Another common dish found at roadside vendors in north and central Florida is boiled peanuts-a southern dish usually found in \"regular\" and \"cajun\" flavors, which taste nothing like roasted peanut. Florida's Natural, a company that sells fruit juice, has a great roadside \"welcome center\" along US 27 in Lake Wales that includes a display and video on the history of citrus growing in Florida and offers samples of several flavors of juice.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nFlorida's coastline is world class, with several gorgeous beaches, bays, and estuaries lying on the coast. The Floridian landscape is flat, with many lakes and wetlands throughout most parts of the state. The only exception is parts of the center in Highlands, Polk, Lake, and a few other counties where rolling hills are common. The highest point in the state is 345ft (105m) and \"Iron mountain\" in Polk county is the highest point on the peninsula at 298ft (81m). Florida's cities tend to be big, sprawling, and well developed. For such a highly populated area there are fortunately still several areas of wilderness left (although they are often found sitting right next to a large city). Many rural parts of the state grow citrus and sugar cane, but farmland tends to be far out from the usual tourist areas. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florida Panhandle"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Florida"]]}," is mostly farmland and pine trees, but as you travel south, you'll see more wetlands and urbanization.

The state's mild winters have made it a haven for retirees year-round and temporary residents during the winter known as \"snowbirds\". Summers can be long and hot, with the interior being a few degrees warmer than the immediate coast. Coastal areas also experience gentle breezes during the summer, and the beach is usually the coolest place to be.\n\nWhile coastal breezes are a welcome relief from the scorching temperatures, they are also the cause of the most notorious Florida weather feature: thunderstorms.  While the storms are often brief, they are common, and anyone visiting Florida during the rainy season (mid-June to September) should plan a few activities indoors in the afternoon as a backup plan. Florida's thunderstorms occur everyday during the rainy season and typically form 20-30mi inland and either move toward the center of the state or toward the coast. While most simply cool the air bringing a welcome relief to stifling temperatures, these storms produce considerable amounts of dangerous lightning and sometimes hail, high winds (50mph+), and tornadoes. See the \"stay safe\" section for thunderstorm safety. Many attractions such as Disney World have multiple attractions available even during downpours.  It is common to be in a rain shower yet be in the sun at the same time.  It is also an interesting contradiction that rain can be occurring just a few miles inland from the coast, while those at the beach experience a beautiful day.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Average Annual Temperatures:"]},"\n\nSummer:\n80.5 °F degrees (26.9 °C) (North Florida)\n82.7 °F degrees (28.2 °C) (South Florida)\n\nWinter:\n53.0 °F degrees (11.7 °C) (North Florida)\n68.5 °F degrees (20.3 °C) (South Florida)\n\nThe above temperatures are average temperatures throughout the day. During the summer, high temperatures on the peninsula are usually around 90 on the coast and mid 90s inland...with lows ranging from around 80 on the coast to mid 70s inland. During the winter, temperatures are much more variable. Freezing temperatures (below 32°F\/0°C) occur at least once a year as far south as central Florida, but even on the coldest days will warm back up into the 50s for a high. It is best to consult the individual city page for temperatures during the winter. The spring is the driest time of the year, which can lead to wildfires nearly every May and early June.\n\nThe six-month ",{"type":"'''","value":["hurricane season"]}," runs from June 1 through November 30 and Floridians have learned to be ready when a storm threatens the area.

Northern Florida has a more Southern style; the south a more Caribbean one. Being on a peninsula, Florida's chefs have always had access to fresh seafood and the long growing season provides for fresh native vegetables.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Citrus"]}," is a main export, and the tourist is apt to see many roadside stands offering free samples of orange juice and fruits to be shipped or carried home. Florida also grows grapefruit, avocado, mango, papaya, passion fruit, kumquat, coconut and other tropical fruits. These often provide the base for sauces and marinades or are used in marmalades, soups, or desserts.

Sweet tea is common throughout the state, although unlike most areas in the south you have a choice between sweet and unsweet.

However, five rural counties in the northern third of the state are \"dry counties\", and no alcohol is sold in them. Liquor stores are often built into strip malls, supermarkets, and pharmacies, and most grocery stores, gas stations, and convenience stores sell beer and wine. Bars and clubs are popular throughout the state. Miami Beach is well known for a variety of themed and upscale bars with innovative mixed drinks.\n\nLike every other U.S. state, the purchase and possession age for alcohol is 21 and is fairly well enforced. Underage drinking \"stings\" are frequent in most tourist areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nMost goods for sale in the state are subject to sales tax. In most of the state the rate is 7%, but varies from 6%-7.5% (6% state sales tax and up to 1.5% local sales tax). This rate is almost never listed on the advertised\/displayed prices.\n\nFlorida is increasingly becoming a major destination for shopping. The Orlando and Miami areas are home to a plethora of shopping malls, including many \"outlet\" malls which are home to shops selling brand-name products for discounted prices and retail shops of name brands which typically are sold through retail companies (Nike, Sony, Tommy Hilfiger, North Face, etc.). There are also a large number of stores selling souvenirs, although most are not locally produced. The Orlando\/Kissimmee region, especially, has a much larger amount of retail stores than typical of US cities. While traditionally these shops catered largely to American families of vacation, these shopping destinations are now serving foreign shoppers. Europeans and recently Brazilians flock to these shopping centers to buy products significantly cheaper than at home and it's not uncommon at some shopping centers in Orlando to encounter tourists from around the globe (especially on weekdays, when most Americans are working). In the last few years, Brazil has become the largest source of international visitors to the state, with many coming on shopping group tours, sometimes wearing matching shirts. Some major shopping centers in Orlando and Miami areas now offer services in Portuguese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\nNearly all hotels offer wi-fi internet access for guests; some even have Ethernet ports for high-speed wired connections. As with much of the Western world, many businesses have wi-fi wireless internet access, sometimes for free. Such businesses even include some clothing\/department stores, grocery stores, and convenience stores in addition to more typical businesses that offer wi-fi like restaurants and shopping malls.\n\nPublic internet access is available at public libraries. At public libraries, wi-fi internet access is almost always free for everyone with their own device (laptop, smartphone, tablet). Computers set up for internet access by patrons require a username and password to access; nearly all libraries will issue a \"guest pass\" for non-cardholders (i.e. non-residents), either for free or for a small charge ($1-2). Use of library computers is subject to time limit which vary widely.\n\nThe large majority of \"internet cafes\" are nominally illegal casinos, set up for online gambling in an attempt to circumvent gambling laws. Such internet cafes did not have typical computers for use, with a mouse and software like Office. Instead, computers at such internet cafes are usually enclosed in a slot-machine-style cover with only buttons to press and set up to view gambling websites. Patrons pay for short periods of time, sometimes using odd methods like buying prepaid phone cards. After a high-profile crackdown on an operator of dozens of such internet cafes, the state banned the opening of all new internet cafes in 2013.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Extreme Temperatures"],[{"type":"''","value":["Never leave children or pets in a parked car for any length of time!"]}," Due to high temperature for most of the year, the interior of a parked car can easily heat to ",{"type":"'''","value":["lethal"]}," temperatures in a short amount of time.

In Florida, stagnant and slow moving freshwater often has ",{"type":"'''","value":["alligators"]}," (as well as poisonous snakes). While they rarely attack humans, it's best not to take your chances.\n\nFlorida has varying crime intensity from city to city. In certain parts of large cities it may not be safe to walk alone or even in small groups at night. These are the exceptions however and most of Florida is safe enough for visitors. Touristy areas rarely have violent crimes, but theft is an occasional occurrence. If the area doesn't feel safe then it probably isn't.\n\nOnly central Africa experiences more lightning than Florida. The afternoon thunderstorms in Florida produce frequent lightning, which kills many people each year and injures many more. Stay indoors during a thunderstorm and never seek shelter under a tree. Most casualties occur on golf courses, but lightning strikes everywhere. If you must go outdoors, try to stay away from tall objects such as trees. Occasionally, summer thunderstorms will bring hail, high winds, and tornadoes. While historic numbers of tornadoes in Florida are somewhat high, the overwhelming majority occur during hurricanes (Jeanne alone spawned over 200 tornadoes in Florida) and the rest during winter cold fronts and summer thunderstorms; however, 99% of them are weak (F-0\/F-1). Thus, while statistics may suggest otherwise, tornadoes are not a big hazard in Florida.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Foreign consulates in Florida"]},"\nPlease note that this list does ",{"type":"<","value":["u",[{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}]]}," include honorary consulates.
