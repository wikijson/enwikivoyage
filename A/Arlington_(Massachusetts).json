A somewhat larger area, including surrounding land, was incorporated on February 27, 1807 as West Cambridge. In 1867, the name \"Arlington\" was chosen in honor of those buried in Arlington National Cemetery; the name change took effect that April 30. Mill Brook, which historically figured largely into Arlington's economy, flows through the town. In 1637 Captain George Cooke built the first mill on the brook. Subsequently, seven mills were built along the stream, including the Old Schwamb Mill, which survives to this day.\n\nPaul Revere's famous midnight ride to alert colonists took him through Menotomy. Later on that first day of the American Revolution, more blood was shed in Menotomy than in the battles of Lexington and Concord combined. Minutemen from surrounding towns converged on Menotomy to ambush the British on their retreat from Concord and Lexington. All in all, 25 colonials were killed in Menotomy (half of all Americans killed in the day's battles), as well as 40 British troops (more than half their fatalities). The colonial soldiers are buried in Arlington's Old Burying Ground\/\n\nThe Jason Russell House, a yellow colonial, is today a museum which remembers those twelve Americans, including Russell himself, who were killed in and around the house on April 19, 1775. Bullet holes are visible in the interior walls to this day.\n\nIn its early years, Arlington was a thriving farming community and had its own lettuce that was quite popular. Arlington had a large ice industry on Spy Pond from the mid-19th century until the advent of refrigeration. The farms were subdivided in the mid-to-late twentieth century. In 1979, the first spreadsheet software program, VisiCalc, was developed by Bob Frankston and Dan Bricklin in the attic of the Arlington apartment rented by Frankston. Today Arlington is largely residential, with many residents employed in Cambridge, Boston and surrounding towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amtrak.com\/ Amtrak"]}]}," train service is available to nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," from many east coast cities as well as Chicago and upstate New York.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Car"]},".
