This simple island is a top destination in Belize for tourists worldwide,and its lack of high-rise hotels or big city public transportation gives the island a relaxed, laid-back feel.\n\nThe July\/August 2008 issue of Islands Magazine featured a list of the Top 10 islands across the world that are most desirable to call home.  Here's an excerpt on why Ambergris Caye made the list:\n\nThe budget-friendly properties available a few flip-flop steps away from the beach, an exuberant expat community and the vibrant streets of San Pedro earned this Central American island a place on our list. It's pretty easy to move here, too, since immigration policies are friendly, the locals speak English and it takes about two hours to reach Belize from Florida. Once there, life on Ambergris Caye entails lazing the days away on star-white beaches, spending afternoons snorkeling the world's second-largest barrier reef and enjoying nights at beachfront barbecues with newfound friends.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nYou can head to the airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belize City"]]}," and book a flight which will take about 20 minutes.
