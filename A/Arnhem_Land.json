The area belongs to the Yolngu Aboriginal people who have lived on and taken care of the land for more than 40,000 years. Nhulunbuy is one of the most isolated areas of Australia, surrounded by beautiful beaches and is a popular adventure fishing spot. The town was built in the early 1970s to service a bauxite mine and alumina refinery, operated by Alcan. However it has also assumed a role as a centre for service provision to Arnhem Land. Its isolation has meant that its natural attractions have had little visibility in the mainstream tourist market. Nhulunbuy is often referred to as \"Gove\", however Gove is actually the peninsula on which the town is located.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:AL2837melvillebaynhulunbuy2.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Port at Wupurr"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nArnhem Land is home to oldest living culture in the world.

Sharing and learning about aboriginal art and culture is central to the Arnhem Land experience.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n\nThis Aboriginal-owned expanse is made up of wild coastlines, deserted islands, rivers teeming with fish, lush rainforests, soaring escarpments and savannah woodland. This land is one of the last great unspoiled areas of the world. Its small population is predominantly indigenous, whose traditional Aboriginal culture remains largely intact. The didjeridu originated in Arnhem Land, and the area is also world-renowned for its distinctive  Aboriginal art.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nArnhem Land is one of the best fishing destinations in the world, mainly owing to its seldom-fished waters. The World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park, Arnhem Land, the Mary River and the Gove Peninsula are home to around 280, or one-third, of Australia's entire collection of bird species, making the region a mecca for bird watchers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nSix seasons of Kakadu and Arnhem Land\nThroughout the year, Kakadu and Arnhem Land's landscapes undergo spectacular changes. Bininj\/Mungguy recognise six different seasons, as well as subtle variations that signpost the transition from one season to another. This knowledge of nature is fundamental to the culture of Kakadu and its people. Bininj\/Mungguy have lived with the changing landscape for tens of thousands of years, adapting and using the land for food, shelter and general well−being.\n\nYegge: Cool weather time, May to June. The wetlands are carpeted with water lilies. Drying winds and flowering Darwin woolly butt tell Bininj\/Mungguy to patchwork burn the woodlands to encourage new growth.\n\nWurrgeng: Early dry season, June to August Most creeks stop flowing and the floodplains quickly dry out. Magpie geese, fat and heavy after weeks of abundant food crowd the shrinking billabongs.\n\nGurrung: Hot dry season, August to October Hunting time for file snakes and long-necked turtles. White-breasted wood swallows arrive as thunderclouds build, signalling the return of Gunumeleng.\n\nGunumeleng: Pre-monsoon, October to December Streams begin to run, water birds spread out as surface water and new growth becomes widespread. Barramundi move from the waterholes downstream to the estuaries to breed.\n\nGudjewg: Monsoon, December to March. The heat and humidity generate an explosion of plant and animal life. Spear grass grows to over two metres tall and creates a silvery-green hue throughout the woodlands.\n\nBanggerreng: Harvest time, April. Clear skies prevail, the vast expanses of floodwater recede and streams start to run clear. Most plants are fruiting and animals are caring for their young.\n\nThe most popular time to visit Arnhem Land is in the dry season (April to September) The wet season sees extremely dramatic weather conditions.
