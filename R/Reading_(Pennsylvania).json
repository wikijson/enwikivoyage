It was once home to one of the largest railway systems in the country (where the familiar Reading Railroad from the Monopoly board comes from) which radiated in all directions from the City of Reading. The construction of the railroad was probably the single greatest factor in the development of Berks county. While Reading has experienced an economic downturn, efforts are being made to try and revitalize the city's downtown area with such projects as the Sovereign Center, the Sovereign Performing Arts Center, the Miller Center and the recently created Goggle Works Center for the Arts, and the Reading Movies 11, which includes an IMAX theater. Today, Reading is a city pulsating with industrial life. It is also well equipped with agencies that represent civilization at it's best-churches, hospitals, clubs, fraternal societies, recreational centers, schools and colleges, a historical society, an art institute, and a daily newspaper. Reading claims the distinction of a symphony orchestra, two choral societies, a chamber musical ensemble, a civic opera company, and many other excellent music groups that have contributed to the city's prestige as a center of art and culture. Reading is not only an excellent place to visit because of what it has to offer but also because of its convenient location in relation to other popular destinations.
