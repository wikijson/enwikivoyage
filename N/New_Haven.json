Today, there is very little risk involved with traveling to New Haven's tourist attractions as streets bustle with crowds generated by hundreds of restaurants, cinemas, theaters, cafes and stores. Luxury apartments and million-dollar condominiums have proliferated, adding a large population base to formerly industrial or commercial zones. In such areas, the downtown area is generally safe at night, but like other cities, late night travel through certain city neighborhoods outside the downtown, without someone who knows the area, is not recommended.  When visiting, exercise the same precautions you would use in any large city.\n\nIt is not recommended to venture outside the Metro North stop at Union Station at night. Taxis wait near the doorway, and it would be wise to take advantage of them if you must arrive in New Haven during the evening. The surrounding area is poorly lit and the surrounding area has seen a variety of violent and non-violent crime.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:New Haven Free Public Library.JPG"],["thumb"],["New Haven Free Public Library"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Mystic (Connecticut)"],["Mystic"]]}," is famous for its seaport, and is a great family tourist attraction.
