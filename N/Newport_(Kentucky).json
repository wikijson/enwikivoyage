In its early years, Newport was home to an army post, which helped to spur the town's growth. Later, it was known as a vice district, given Cincinnati's conservative nature it was a perfect nearby refuge for burlesque, gambling, and other vices.  The City had a strong mafia presence for many years.\n\nToday, it is proximity to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cincinnati"]]}," that provides the spur, as Newport's hotels and riverfront area draw visitors from the Queen City.
