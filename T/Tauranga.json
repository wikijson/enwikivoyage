The town and headland of Mount Maunganui stand at the entrance to the harbour, five kilometres north of Tauranga. \"The Mount\", as it is known, is often regarded as a satellite town of Tauranga, although it is technically a suburb. It is one of the major resort cities in New Zealand, famous for its beautiful beaches.\n\nThe name Tauranga comes from Maori, it roughly translates to \"a sheltered anchorage\".\n\nDue to its sheltered position on the east coast, Tauranga enjoys a warm, dry climate. This has made it a popular location to retire to. During the summer months the population swells as holidaymakers descend on the city.\n\nMuch of the countryside surrounding Tauranga is horticultural land, used to grow a wide range of fresh produce for both domestic consumption and export. The area is particularly well known for growing tangelos (a grapefruit \/ tangerine cross) and kiwifruit. The Port of Tauranga also experiences brisk but seasonal shipping traffic and is a regular stop off for both container ships and luxury cruise liners.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDriving routes are State Highway 2 from Waihi, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]}," via the scenic Karangahake Gorge; SH 29 over the Kaimai Range from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waikato"]]}," (also an option from Auckland via SH 27 onto SH 29); SH 36 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotorua"]]}," via Pyes Pa (now sealed all the way); SH 2 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Te Puke"]]},", the western Bay of Plenty (and Rotorua via SH 33).\n\nTauranga Airport has regular ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airnz.co.nz Air New Zealand"]}," direct flights from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/nakedbus.com\/ Naked Bus"]}," offers daily departures to most North Island locations, including Waitomo Caves, with fares starting at $1.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.intercitycoach.co.nz\/ Intercity Coachlines"]}," stop in downtown Tauranga en route from numerous parts of New Zealand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nA very reliable bus system services the Tauranga, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Maunganui"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Papamoa"]]}," & ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Te Puke"]]}," areas.
