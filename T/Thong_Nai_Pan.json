[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Thong Nai Pan"]}," (or just ",{"type":"'''","value":["TNP"]}," among backpackers) is an area on the northeastern tip of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Pha Ngan"]]}," that includes the two beach resorts of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ao Thong Nai Pan Noi"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ao Thong Nai Pan Yai"]},". They are maybe the most secluded yet developed beaches on the island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Yai"]}," means \"large\", and it's the larger and more developed of the two beaches. ",{"type":"''","value":["Noi"]}," means \"small\", and the beach here is about half the size of Yai.  The two are a 15-minute hike apart.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Road to Ao Thong Nai Pan.JPG"],["thumb"],["The road to Thong Nai Pan"]]},"\n\nFrom the island's harbour at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thong Sala"]]},", there will be one or more songthaews waiting, holding up signs with their destinations. Price is a fixed 300 baht\/person. Some taxis don't go to both beaches, so check for the Noi\/Yai extension on their signs. As the beaches are less travelled and a long ride, sometimes you'll have to wait for the next boat to arrive, or even the boat after that, because the driver won't drive up and down for just 1 or 2 passengers.  Once they do take off, the trip is about half an hour.\n\nSince you've chosen this destination you're unlikely to be in a hurry. But if, for some reason you are and you are a little bit more adventurous, then catch a quick ride to the town (or even walk. From the harbour, take a left on the main street till the roundabout). Here you can rent a typical Thai 125 cc motorbike (~200 baht\/day) or a 4 x 4 for 700-1,000 baht\/day. It's about 15 km and it will take you around 30-40 minutes to drive.\n\nThe road to Thong Nai Pan begins at Ban Tai village (on the main road between Thong Sala and Haad Rin). The road from Ban Tai to Thong Nai Pan is 13.4 km and about half of it is now paved.   From the first mountain outside of Ban Tai to the Than Sadet turn off, the road is unpaved all the way and has some nasty hills with lots of dust and gravel. Once you get to the Than Sadet turn off, the road is concrete the rest of the way (7.5 km) and much better. Care should still be taken as there are some deceptively sharp dusty corners. The improved road from the Than Sadet turn off to Thong Nai Pan has greatly reduced travelling times.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Try to catch a glimpse of the huge, harmless lizards that are unique to this area."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Older, mostly European men, wearing thongs, Speedos, or other skimpy bathing attire."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Walk to the waterfalls.
