History tells that she was a young Illinois girl kidnapped by (presumably) Yavapai Indians and forced to work for them as a slave. Later, she was traded to Mohave Indians who adopted her as a daughter, had her face tattooed in the custom of the tribe, and eventually released her in 1855 near the current site of the town.\n\nGold was discovered in the nearby hills in the early 1900's and the town was home to a boom that lasted until the mines closed in the 1930s. The current population of 150 is down from about 23,000 in its boom years. The main street, lined with gift shops, looks like a set from a Hollywood Western, and with good reason: Hollywood dolled up the facades to film How The West Was Won ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0056085\/"]}," here in 1962. A staged gunfight takes place every day at high noon. On the other side of the equation, if you show up after the tourists go home, you'll start to get a real feel for the place: a town of grizzled miners and dogged entrepreneurs determined to make a living at the far edge of civilization.\n\nWhile the main street is known alternatively as \"Main Street\" and \"Oatman Road\", it is also the Historic Route 66.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Oatman Chamber of Commerce"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.oatmangoldroad.org\/"],["email=oatman@oatmangoldroad.org"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 928-768-6222"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["35.02639"],["-114.38362"],["zoom=17"]]},"\n\nFollow ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Route 66"]]}," from Kingman or Laughlin.

Oatman is about 13 miles (21 km) down the road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThose expecting to find transportation available from the Oatman Metropolitan Subway System (OMSS), or even simple bus and monorail transportation, will be disappointed at the lack of options. For those able to put that disappointment aside, the tiny town is completely walkable; however, due to the frequent burro visits be careful where you walk.

They're available afterward for photographs. Road traffic will be held up for the duration of the show.\n\nA group of wild burros visits daily to munch on carrots that local shopkeepers are all too happy to sell. They have become obese from the practice and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has requested shop managers stop selling carrots. Some are selling alfalfa cubes to offer the burros instead. Feeding baby burros is discouraged, and some may sport a \"Do Not Feed\" sticker on their foreheads, provided by the BLM. Feeding wild burros on the road outside the town of Oatman is not legal and causes a road hazard. Pull well off to the side of the road to watch them.\n\nNote that despite the fact that they roam main street and will walk right up to passersby, these are in fact wild burros and will kick, bite, and otherwise behave like wild animals if they feel threatened. Keep dogs away from them as the burros won't distinguish a dog from a coyote and will attempt to kick and\/or stomp it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Gold Road Mine Tour"],["url="],["email=goldroad@goldroadmine.com"],["address=Route 66 (Just east of Oatman)"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 928-768-1600"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 928-768-9588"],["hours=11AM-5PM"],["price=$12\/6 (adults\/children under 12)"],["content=Tour of century-old mine shaft lasts about an hour."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Oatman Stables"],["url=http:\/\/www.oatmanstables.com\/"],["email=66ranch@frontier.com"],["address=Route 66"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 928-788-1764"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$25\/½hr, $35\/1hr, $60\/2hr"],["content=Horseback rides."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=July 4th Sidewalk Egg Frying Contest"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.oatmangoldroad.org\/events.htm"],["email=spirit_mtn@hotmail.com"],["address="],["lat=35.02687"],["long=-114.38410"],["directions=by the post office"],["phone=+1 928-768-8595"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=12pm"],["price="],["content=An annual event, contestants can participate in groups or singly, originality is encouraged."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe downtown contains a large number of souvenir and other stores.
